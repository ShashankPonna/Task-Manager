# Task Manager App

A fully functional, modern **Task Manager** built using **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. This app allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with persistent storage using **localStorage**. The design is inspired by modern UI trends with a clean and responsive interface.
